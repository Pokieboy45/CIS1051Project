# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
one of the following:
Ben's Pokedex
The Ultimate Pokedex
A Master's Guide to the Pokedex

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will act as an android application for a pokedex.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My pokedex will not only tell the types and evolution to the pokemon but will also immediately tell the base stat totals. It will be written in java, the information will be displayed on the screen. Ideally there will be a home page which will have a search bar and a series of drop down selectors that will allow the user to see the information. On top of this I would like to add data that will give my advice on which game to shiny hunt the pokemon in (Using generations 7-9), as well as locations of each encounter and tips on how to use each pokemon. The app should also include a picture of the pokemon in the display with an option to view the shiny form and alternate forms if applicable.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Project is only designed for this course.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

This project will be completed alone. 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I WILL have a working prototype that will allow the user to flip through and see an image of the pokemon, its home region, base stats, typing and name.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I THINK I will be able to incorporate the home screen with sufficient drop down lists and ways to narrow down the search, along with notes on my recommendations on how best to shiny hunt that pokemon.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I HOPE I can add a way to add issue handling - if the user mispells the pokemon name they should still be able to get to the page they want. In addition I would like to add some kind of fun fact to every entry but that is not necessary. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are plentiful. I will first need to watch all the Harvard CS50 videos to better understand the Java language and may need to conduct more learning before truly starting. Additionally, If it would be possible to store all the data into a CSV file to be extracted and used then that may prove beneficial. Once I can understand the basics of java and app development, the rest of the project should flow fairly smoothly.
