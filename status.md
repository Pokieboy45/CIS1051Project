#### Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have followed the tutorial videos to display the recycler view and basic information (name, ID, Types). In addition I have added an image of the pokemon to each page. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet added a view of the base stats, home region, regional filters, or a shiny tracking checkbox. Unfortunately, some of these ideas will need to be scrapped. I would also like to add a shiny sprite of the pokemon to each page, if possible.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have encountered several problems/issues. Primarily I do not know java so this project has been quite a challenge. The regional filters will likely not be an implemented feature due to the construction of the base program and the source api. The shiny tracking checkbox is also a big challenge due to the writing aspect of this goal and the format of the pokedex code itself.
