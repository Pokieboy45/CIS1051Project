# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Pokedex with tips to shiny hunt and an interface that is user friendly.

Sidescroller similar to Geometry dash or other mario clones.

Maybe a text based game akin to pig? perhaps something closer to go fish or blackjack?

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No, I will work alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How much do I need to add to my pokedex for it to be accepted as a final project?
