## Challenges
Java was a language that I had never touched before. App development was also a new concept to me. Through many hours of google searches and struggling, I was able to complete this pokedex. It does not accomplish everything I had hoped it to; however, it does show the following features: Name, ID, Sprite & shiny sprite, Base stats, and a tip on how best to use that pokemon.
